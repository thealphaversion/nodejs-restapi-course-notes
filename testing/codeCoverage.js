// we wnat to see just how much of our code is covered by tests
// so we add the --coverage flag to the test script in package.json

// we get a table in the console
// alternatively, we can check the coverage folder that is now created
// in there we will find index.html where a much better representation is shown

// now what this representation means is that, that much amount of code is somewhere called in our tests.
