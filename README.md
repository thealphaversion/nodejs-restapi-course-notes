# nodejs-restapi-course-notes

This repository contains all of my notes that I made while following the course
[Node.js: The Complete Guide to Build RESTful APIs](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-master-class) by [Mosh Hamedani](https://codewithmosh.com).

The course project is [available here](https://github.com/thealphaversion/vidly-nodejs-course). It supports some parts of notes in this repo.
Hence, it is suggested, but not mandatory that you have both of these repositories to follow.

#### Order of Progress
